### Running the tests

Since the task of the library is inherently bound to an external service
mocking would probably make the tests useless. Therefore all tests
integration level and need a S3 endpoint which is configurable through the
`S3_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

The tests are known to run successfully against
[`zenko/cloudserver`](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenko/cloudserver/) and
obviously real AWS S3 (which nonetheless is not recommended due to cost and
speed) while they are known to fail against
[`localstack/localstack`](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack/) because
of bugs in its versioning implementation (though the library should still
work on unversioned localstack buckets).
